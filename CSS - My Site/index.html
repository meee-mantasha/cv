        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p> Designing and Development has always been a field of interest for me so I decided to become a web developer.I started learning to web development last year(in November,2020) because I wanted to do something which could show case my creativity and I always wanted to build websites on my own. I regitered for an udemy course by Angela Yu to learn how to code for web development . Over time, I have gained a wealth of knowledge in designing and developing basic web pages and websites.</p>

        <h3>HTML5 and CSS</h3>
        <p>HTML5 is a programming language whose acronym stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is a system that allows the modification of the appearance of web pages, as well as making adjustments to their appearance. It also used to structure and present content for the web</p>
        <p>
           css is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.
